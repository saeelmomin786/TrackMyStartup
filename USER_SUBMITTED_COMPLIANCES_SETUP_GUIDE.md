# User-Submitted Compliances Feature Setup Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This feature allows **Startup**, **CA**, and **CS** users to submit new compliance requirements for their companies' parent operations, subsidiaries, or international operations. Admins can then review and approve these submissions to add them to the main compliance rules database.

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Step 1: Create the User Submitted Compliances Table

Run the following SQL in your **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of CREATE_USER_SUBMITTED_COMPLIANCES_TABLE.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ `user_submitted_compliances` table with all necessary fields
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies for proper access control
- ✅ Indexes for optimal performance
- ✅ Triggers for automatic timestamp updates

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation

Run these verification queries:

```sql
-- Check if table was created
SELECT 'User Submitted Compliances Table Created Successfully' as info;

-- Check total submissions
SELECT 'Total User Submissions' as info, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.user_submitted_compliances;

-- Check submissions by status
SELECT 'Submissions by Status' as info, status, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM public.user_submitted_compliances 
GROUP BY status;

-- Check submissions by operation type
SELECT 'Submissions by Operation Type' as info, operation_type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM public.user_submitted_compliances 
GROUP BY operation_type;
```
