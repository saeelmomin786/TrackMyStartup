# Debug: Investment Advisor Document Fields Not Showing

## Issue
The "Complete Your Registration" page only shows 2 document fields instead of 4 for Investment Advisor role:
- ✅ Government ID (showing)
- ✅ Proof of Organization Registration (showing)
- ❌ License (As per country regulations) (not showing)
- ❌ Company Logo (not showing)

## Debug Changes Made

### 1. Added Console Logging
```typescript
// Debug: Log the user role
console.log('DocumentUploadStep - User role:', userData.role);
console.log('DocumentUploadStep - Is Investment Advisor?', userData.role === 'Investment Advisor');
```

### 2. Added Visual Debug Info
- Added role display in the UI: `Role: {userData.role}`
- Added debug box that shows when role is NOT "Investment Advisor"

### 3. Enhanced Role Comparison
```typescript
// More robust role checking
{(userData.role === 'Investment Advisor' || userData.role?.trim() === 'Investment Advisor') && (
  // License and Logo upload fields
)}
```

### 4. Added Debug Box
When the role is NOT "Investment Advisor", a yellow debug box will appear showing:
- The actual role value
- The length of the role string
- Expected values for comparison

## Testing Steps

### 1. Register as Investment Advisor
1. Go to registration page
2. Select "Investment Advisor" from the role dropdown
3. Fill in basic information and proceed to document upload

### 2. Check Debug Information
1. **Look at the page**: You should see "Role: Investment Advisor" displayed
2. **Check browser console**: Look for the debug logs
3. **Look for debug box**: If the role doesn't match exactly, you'll see a yellow debug box

### 3. Expected Results

**If working correctly:**
- Console shows: `DocumentUploadStep - User role: Investment Advisor`
- Console shows: `DocumentUploadStep - Is Investment Advisor? true`
- Page shows: "Role: Investment Advisor"
- All 4 document fields are visible:
  - Government ID
  - Proof of Firm Registration
  - License (As per country regulations)
  - Company Logo

**If not working:**
- Console shows the actual role value
- Yellow debug box appears with role details
- Only 2 document fields are visible

## Possible Issues

### 1. Role Value Mismatch
- Extra spaces in the role value
- Different casing
- Special characters

### 2. Data Flow Issue
- Role not being passed correctly from BasicRegistrationStep
- Role being modified somewhere in the flow

### 3. Component Rendering Issue
- Conditional rendering not working
- React state not updating

## Next Steps

1. **Test the registration** with the debug changes
2. **Check the console logs** to see the actual role value
3. **Look for the debug box** if fields don't appear
4. **Report the findings** so we can fix the exact issue

The debug information will help us identify exactly what's happening with the role value and why the conditional rendering isn't working.

## Files Modified

- ✅ `components/DocumentUploadStep.tsx` - Added debug logging and enhanced role checking

## Expected Outcome

Once we identify the exact issue with the role value, we can fix it and the Investment Advisor document fields should appear correctly.
