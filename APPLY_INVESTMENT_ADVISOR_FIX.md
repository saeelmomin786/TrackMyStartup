# Apply Investment Advisor Fix

## ðŸš¨ **URGENT: Frontend Filtering Issue**

The problem is in the `InvestmentAdvisorView.tsx` component. The filtering logic is completely broken.

## ðŸ”§ **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Step 1: Open the Component File**
Open: `components/InvestmentAdvisorView.tsx`

### **Step 2: Find the Broken Section**
Look for lines 113-180 (the filtering logic section)

### **Step 3: Replace the Entire Section**
Replace the entire section from line 113 to line 180 with the code from `DIRECT_INVESTMENT_ADVISOR_FIX.tsx`

### **Step 4: Key Changes**

**BEFORE (Broken):**
```typescript
// Use pending relationships from database instead of broken user field logic
const serviceRequests = useMemo(() => {
  // ... broken logic using pendingRelationships
  return pendingRelationships || [];
}, [pendingRelationships, currentUser?.investment_advisor_code, users, startups]);
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Get pending startup requests - CORRECTED VERSION
const pendingStartupRequests = useMemo(() => {
  // ... proper filtering logic
}, [startups, users, currentUser?.investment_advisor_code]);

// Get pending investor requests - CORRECTED VERSION  
const pendingInvestorRequests = useMemo(() => {
  // ... proper filtering logic
}, [users, currentUser?.investment_advisor_code]);

// Create serviceRequests by combining pending startups and investors
const serviceRequests = useMemo(() => {
  // ... combine the results
}, [pendingStartupRequests, pendingInvestorRequests, users]);
```

### **Step 5: Test the Fix**

After applying the fix:
1. **Refresh the dashboard**
2. **Check the console logs** - should show detailed debug info
3. **Verify Siddhi sees his 2 startup requests**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**

After the fix:
- âœ… **Siddhi (IA-162090)** should see 2 pending startup requests
- âœ… **Sarvesh (IA-629552)** should see 2 pending startup requests  
- âœ… **Farah (INV-00C39B)** should see 1 pending startup request
- âœ… **Console logs** should show detailed filtering debug info

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Issue**

The current code is using `pendingRelationships` from database relationships instead of properly filtering the actual `startups` and `users` arrays. This is why you see "No pending service requests" even though the data exists.

The fix replaces the broken database relationship logic with proper array filtering logic that actually works!
