# Apply Investment Advisor Acceptance Fix

## 🐛 **Problem**
The Investment Advisor can see the requests but cannot accept them due to RLS (Row Level Security) policy restrictions.

**Error:** `PGRST116: Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object`

## ✅ **Solution**
Run the SQL script to fix RLS policies and create a bypass function.

## 🚀 **How to Apply**

### Step 1: Run the Database Fix
Execute `COMPLETE_INVESTMENT_ADVISOR_ACCEPTANCE_FIX.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor.

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. **Refresh the dashboard** - requests should still be visible
2. **Click "Accept Request"** on a startup - should work without errors
3. **Check console logs** - should show successful acceptance

## 🔧 **What the Fix Does**

1. **Creates SECURITY DEFINER Function**: `accept_startup_advisor_request()` that bypasses RLS
2. **Updates RLS Policies**: Allows Investment Advisors to update users who entered their code
3. **Updates Database Code**: Uses the new function instead of direct table updates

## 📋 **Expected Results**

- ✅ **Requests visible** - 2 startup requests should show
- ✅ **Acceptance works** - No more RLS errors
- ✅ **Data updated** - `advisor_accepted = true` in database
- ✅ **Relationships created** - Proper advisor-startup relationships

## 🎯 **Test Cases**

1. **Siddhi (IA-162090)** should see:
   - 2 pending startup requests
   - Can accept both requests successfully
   - Requests move to "My Startups" after acceptance

2. **Other Advisors** should work the same way for their respective codes

## 🚨 **If Issues Persist**

1. Check Supabase logs for any SQL errors
2. Verify the function was created successfully
3. Check RLS policies are applied correctly
4. Test the function directly in SQL Editor

The fix is comprehensive and should resolve all acceptance issues! 🎉
