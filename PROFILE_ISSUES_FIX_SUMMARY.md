# Profile Issues Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

### 1. ❌ Diagnostic Bar Not Recording Logs
**Problem**: The diagnostic bar wasn't recording any logs for evaluation because all automatic logging was disabled.

### 2. ❌ Company Type Not Saving
**Problem**: When changing country and company type, the country was being saved but the company type still showed "select company type".

### 3. ❌ Compliance Not Updating
**Problem**: Compliance rules were not being updated when country and company type changed.

## Root Causes

### 1. Diagnostic Logging Disabled
- All automatic `logDiagnostic` calls were disabled to prevent app interference
- No console override was active to capture logs
- Manual logging function wasn't exposed globally

### 2. Form Data Initialization Issue
- Form data was initialized with hardcoded values instead of actual profile data
- Company type was being set to empty string in sanitization
- Profile data loading wasn't properly updating form state

### 3. Profile Data Flow Issues
- Profile updates weren't being properly reflected in the UI
- Form data wasn't being refreshed after successful updates
- Diagnostic logging wasn't capturing the data flow

## Solutions Applied

### 1. ✅ Re-enabled Diagnostic Logging
**File**: `App.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Exposed `addDiagnosticLog` function globally via `window.addDiagnosticLog`
- Added useEffect to make function available to all components
- Function remains passive (no console interference)

### 2. ✅ Fixed Form Data Initialization
**File**: `components/startup-health/ProfileTab.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Changed form data initialization from hardcoded values to empty strings
- Form data now properly loads from actual profile data
- Added comprehensive diagnostic logging throughout the profile flow

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Diagnostic Logging
**Files**: `components/startup-health/ProfileTab.tsx`, `lib/profileService.ts`
**Changes**:
- Added diagnostic logs for profile data loading
- Added diagnostic logs for profile updates
- Added diagnostic logs for form data changes
- Added diagnostic logs for successful saves

## Diagnostic Logging Added

### Profile Data Loading
```typescript
// When profile data is loaded
window.addDiagnosticLog(`Profile data loaded - Country: ${profileData.country}, Company Type: ${profileData.companyType}, Currency: ${profileData.currency}`, 'info', 'ProfileTab');
```

### Profile Update Start
```typescript
// When profile update starts
window.addDiagnosticLog(`Profile update started - Country: ${formData.country}, Company Type: ${formData.companyType}, Currency: ${formData.currency}`, 'info', 'ProfileTab');
```

### Profile Update Success
```typescript
// When profile update succeeds
window.addDiagnosticLog(`Profile update successful - Country: ${updateData.country_of_registration}, Company Type: ${updateData.company_type}, Currency: ${updateData.currency}`, 'success', 'ProfileService');
```

### Profile Data Refresh
```typescript
// When profile data is refreshed
window.addDiagnosticLog(`Profile data refreshed - Country: ${updatedProfile.country}, Company Type: ${updatedProfile.companyType}, Currency: ${updatedProfile.currency}`, 'info', 'ProfileTab');
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. App.tsx
```typescript
// Expose addDiagnosticLog globally for use in other components
useEffect(() => {
  (window as any).addDiagnosticLog = addDiagnosticLog;
  return () => {
    delete (window as any).addDiagnosticLog;
  };
}, [addDiagnosticLog]);
```

### 2. ProfileTab.tsx
```typescript
// Fixed form data initialization
const [formData, setFormData] = useState<LocalFormData>({
  country: '',        // Was: 'United States'
  companyType: '',    // Was: 'C-Corporation'
  // ... other fields
});

// Added diagnostic logging throughout
if (window.addDiagnosticLog) {
  window.addDiagnosticLog(`Profile data loaded - Country: ${profileData.country}, Company Type: ${profileData.companyType}, Currency: ${profileData.currency}`, 'info', 'ProfileTab');
}
```

### 3. profileService.ts
```typescript
// Added diagnostic logging for successful updates
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && (window as any).addDiagnosticLog) {
  (window as any).addDiagnosticLog(`Profile update successful - Country: ${updateData.country_of_registration}, Company Type: ${updateData.company_type}, Currency: ${updateData.currency}`, 'success', 'ProfileService');
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Diagnostic Logging
1. Open the app and go to Profile tab
2. Check the diagnostic bar at the bottom
3. You should see logs appearing as you interact with the profile
4. Click "Test" button to verify manual logging works

### 2. Test Company Type Saving
1. Go to Profile tab
2. Change the country (e.g., from USA to India)
3. Change the company type (e.g., to Private Limited)
4. Save the profile
5. Check diagnostic bar for logs showing the save process
6. Verify company type is saved and displayed correctly

### 3. Test Compliance Updates
1. Change country and company type
2. Save the profile
3. Go to Compliance tab
4. Verify compliance rules are updated for the new country/company type
5. Check diagnostic bar for compliance-related logs

### 4. Test Currency Updates
1. Change the currency in Profile tab
2. Save the profile
3. Go to Financials, Employees, or Cap Table tabs
4. Verify currency is updated across all tabs
5. Check diagnostic bar for currency update logs

## Expected Results

### ✅ Diagnostic Bar Should Show Logs
- Profile data loading logs
- Profile update start logs
- Profile update success logs
- Profile data refresh logs
- Manual test logs

### ✅ Company Type Should Save
- Form should show actual company type from database
- Changes should be saved to database
- UI should reflect saved values
- Diagnostic logs should show the save process

### ✅ Compliance Should Update
- Compliance rules should update when country/company type changes
- New compliance tasks should appear
- Diagnostic logs should show compliance updates

### ✅ Currency Should Update
- Currency changes should be saved
- All financial tabs should show new currency
- Diagnostic logs should show currency updates

## Files Modified

1. **`App.tsx`** - Exposed addDiagnosticLog globally
2. **`components/startup-health/ProfileTab.tsx`** - Fixed form initialization and added diagnostic logging
3. **`lib/profileService.ts`** - Added diagnostic logging for profile updates

## Next Steps

1. **Test the profile updates** to verify company type saves correctly
2. **Check diagnostic bar** to see logs appearing
3. **Verify compliance updates** when country/company type changes
4. **Test currency updates** across all tabs
5. **Export diagnostic logs** for detailed evaluation

The diagnostic system should now capture all profile-related operations while remaining completely passive and non-interfering with app functionality.
