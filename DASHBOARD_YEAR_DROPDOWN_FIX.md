# Dashboard Year Dropdown Fix

## Problem
The dashboard year dropdown was showing empty because it was based on financial records, but there were no financial records yet for new companies.

## Solution
Changed the year dropdown to be based on the company registration date instead of financial records.

## Changes Made

### **Before (Based on Financial Records)**
```typescript
// Load all financial records to get available years
const allRecords = await financialsService.getFinancialRecords(startup.id);

// Extract available years
const years = [...new Set(allRecords.map(record => new Date(record.date).getFullYear()))]
  .sort((a, b) => b - a);
setAvailableYears(years);
```

### **After (Based on Company Registration Date)**
```typescript
// Generate available years based on company registration date
const registrationYear = new Date(startup.registrationDate).getFullYear();
const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();

// Create array of years from registration year to current year + 1 (for future planning)
const years = [];
for (let year = currentYear + 1; year >= registrationYear; year--) {
  years.push(year);
}
setAvailableYears(years);
```

## How It Works

### **Example Scenarios**

1. **Company registered in 2024, current year 2024:**
   - Available years: 2025, 2024
   - Shows 2 years (current + 1 future)

2. **Company registered in 2022, current year 2024:**
   - Available years: 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022
   - Shows 4 years (registration to current + 1 future)

3. **Company registered in 2020, current year 2024:**
   - Available years: 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020
   - Shows 6 years (registration to current + 1 future)

### **Benefits**
- âœ… **Always Shows Years**: No longer depends on financial records
- âœ… **Registration-Based**: Years start from company registration date
- âœ… **Future Planning**: Includes next year for planning purposes
- âœ… **Chronological Order**: Years are sorted from newest to oldest
- âœ… **Dynamic**: Automatically adjusts based on company age

## Files Updated
- `components/startup-health/StartupDashboardTab.tsx` - Updated year calculation logic

The dashboard year dropdown will now always show years based on the company registration date! ðŸŽ¯
