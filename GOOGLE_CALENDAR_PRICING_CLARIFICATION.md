## 🛡️ How to Stay Free

### 1. Set Up Billing Alerts

Even though you won't be charged, set up alerts to be safe:

1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. **"Billing"** → **"Budgets & alerts"**
3. Create a budget with **$0 limit**
4. Set alert at **$0.01** (so you're notified if anything charges)

### 2. Monitor Usage

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** → **"Dashboard"**
2. Check **"Calendar API"** usage
3. You'll see quota usage (not billing)

### 3. Disable Unnecessary Services

- Only enable **Calendar API** (what you need)
- Don't enable other services you don't need
