-- SYSTEMIC FIX FOR ESOP AND FOUNDER SHARES
-- =====================================================
-- This script fixes the issue where ESOP reserved shares and founder shares
-- are not properly calculated during registration, affecting all startups

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 2: FIX ESOP RESERVED SHARES
-- =====================================================
-- Fix cases where ESOP reserved shares are incorrectly set to total shares
-- (This happens when the registration form doesn't properly calculate ESOP shares)

-- Update ESOP reserved shares to reasonable defaults for problematic cases
UPDATE startup_shares 
SET 
    esop_reserved_shares = CASE 
        -- If ESOP reserved equals total shares, set to 10% of total shares

    (esop_reserved_shares > (total_shares * 0.5));

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 3: FIX FOUNDER SHARES
-- =====================================================
-- Update founder shares to ensure total allocation equals total shares
-- This distributes the remaining shares among founders

-- For startups with only one founder, give them all remaining shares

    SELECT s.id 
    FROM startups s
    JOIN startup_shares ss ON s.id = ss.startup_id
    WHERE ss.total_shares > 0
);

-- For startups with multiple founders, distribute remaining shares proportionally
-- (This is more complex and would require individual review)

SELECT

GROUP BY f.startup_id

-- NOTES FOR FUTURE PREVENTION
-- =====================================================
/*
PREVENTION MEASURES:

1. The registration form has been updated to auto-calculate founder shares
2. Validation has been added to ensure founder shares + ESOP reserved = total shares
3. This script should be run periodically to catch any edge cases

RECOMMENDED ESOP PERCENTAGES:
- Early stage startups: 10-15% of total shares
- Growth stage startups: 15-20% of total shares
- Mature startups: 10-12% of total shares

The script above sets ESOP to 10% of total shares for problematic cases,
which is a reasonable default for most startups.
