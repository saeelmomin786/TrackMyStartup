# Supabase Security Fixes - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides safe implementation of security fixes for your Supabase database without affecting existing functionality.

## Issues Addressed
1. **Row Level Security (RLS) disabled** on 7 public tables
2. **Function search_path mutable** on 100+ functions  
3. **Security Definer views** requiring review
4. **Authentication security** settings
5. **PostgreSQL version** upgrade needed

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Your Database
```bash
# Create a backup before making changes
pg_dump -h your-db-host -U postgres -d your-database > backup_before_security_fixes.sql
```

### Step 2: Run the Security Fix Script
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `security_fixes.sql`
4. Execute the script

### Step 3: Verify the Fixes
Run these verification queries in your SQL editor:

```sql
-- Check RLS status on all tables
SELECT * FROM public.check_rls_status();

-- Check function search paths  
SELECT * FROM public.check_function_search_paths();

-- Verify no tables are missing RLS
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND rowsecurity = false;
```

### Step 4: Authentication Settings (Supabase Dashboard)
1. Go to Authentication > Settings
2. Set **OTP expiry** to 30 minutes (or less)
3. Enable **Leaked password protection**
4. Review password requirements

### Step 5: Database Upgrade
1. Go to Settings > Database
2. Upgrade PostgreSQL to the latest version
3. Monitor for any issues after upgrade

## What the Script Does

### RLS Implementation
- **Enables RLS** on all public tables that were missing it
- **Creates permissive policies** that maintain existing access patterns
- **Preserves functionality** by allowing authenticated users full access

### Function Security
- **Sets search_path** to 'public' for all functions
- **Prevents search path attacks** while maintaining functionality
- **Uses SECURITY DEFINER** appropriately for the search_path setting

### Documentation
- **Adds comments** to SECURITY DEFINER views for review
- **Creates helper functions** to monitor security status
- **Provides verification queries** to ensure fixes worked

## Safety Measures

### Minimal Impact Policies
The RLS policies created are intentionally permissive:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations for authenticated users" 
ON public.table_name FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

This maintains existing functionality while enabling RLS.

### Function Search Path
All functions get `search_path = 'public'` which:
- Prevents search path manipulation attacks
- Maintains existing functionality
- Uses secure defaults

### No Breaking Changes
- No existing policies are modified
- No function signatures are changed
- No data access patterns are altered

## Testing After Implementation

1. **Test your application** - ensure all features work
2. **Check authentication** - verify login/signup works
3. **Test database queries** - ensure all queries execute properly
4. **Monitor logs** - watch for any new errors

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur, you can:
1. **Disable RLS** on specific tables: `ALTER TABLE table_name DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
2. **Drop policies**: `DROP POLICY policy_name ON table_name;`
3. **Restore from backup** if needed

## Monitoring
After implementation, monitor:
- Application functionality
- Database performance
- Security audit results
- User authentication flows

## Next Steps
1. Run the security fixes script
2. Test your application thoroughly
3. Monitor for any issues
4. Consider more restrictive RLS policies based on your business logic
5. Review SECURITY DEFINER views for potential security improvements
