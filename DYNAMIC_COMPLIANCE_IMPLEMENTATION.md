# Dynamic Compliance Implementation - Complete Guide

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of a dynamic, real-time compliance system that automatically generates compliance tasks based on country, company type, and registration dates. The system includes document upload functionality, real-time updates, and comprehensive backend integration.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ **Dynamic Task Generation**
- **Year-based generation**: Tasks are generated from registration year to current year
- **Country-specific rules**: Different compliance requirements for each country/company type
- **Entity support**: Handles both parent company and subsidiaries
- **Automatic updates**: New tasks are added each year automatically

### ✅ **Real-Time Data**
- **Live updates**: Profile changes immediately reflect in compliance tasks
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Changes are pushed to all connected clients
- **No page refresh required**: Seamless user experience

### ✅ **Document Upload System**
- **Active upload buttons**: Users can upload compliance documents
- **File management**: Support for multiple file types (PDF, DOC, images)
- **Document tracking**: View uploaded documents with metadata
- **Secure storage**: Files stored in Supabase storage with proper permissions

### ✅ **CA/CS Verification System**
- **Role-based access**: CA and CS users can update verification status
- **Status management**: Pending, Verified, Rejected, Not Required
- **Audit trail**: Track who updated what and when

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Backend Services (`lib/complianceService.ts`)

```typescript
class ComplianceService {
    // Get compliance tasks for a startup
    async getComplianceTasks(startupId: number, filters?: ComplianceFilters)
    
    // Update compliance status
    async updateComplianceStatus(startupId: number, taskId: string, checker: 'ca' | 'cs', newStatus: ComplianceStatus)
    
    // Upload compliance document
    async uploadComplianceDocument(startupId: number, taskId: string, file: File, uploadedBy: string)
    
    // Get compliance uploads for a task
    async getComplianceUploads(startupId: number, taskId: string)
    
    // Real-time subscriptions
    subscribeToComplianceChanges(startupId: number, callback: (payload: any) => void)
}
```

### 2. Database Schema

#### `compliance_checks` Table
- Stores compliance task status and verification information
- Links to startup and tracks CA/CS verification status
- Includes audit trail (who updated what and when)

#### `compliance_uploads` Table
- Stores uploaded document metadata
- Links documents to specific compliance tasks
- Tracks file information and upload history

#### Storage Bucket
- `compliance-documents` bucket for file storage
- Organized by startup ID and task ID
- Secure access policies

### 3. Frontend Components

#### ComplianceTab (`components/startup-health/ComplianceTab.tsx`)
- **Dynamic task generation** using `useMemo`
- **Real-time data loading** with backend integration
- **Upload functionality** with modal interface
- **Filtering system** by entity and year
- **Status management** for CA/CS verification

#### ProfileTab (`components/startup-health/ProfileTab.tsx`)
- **Real-time updates** when profile changes
- **Backend integration** for data persistence
- **Callback system** to notify parent components

## Compliance Rules Logic

### Year-Based Generation
```javascript
// Generate tasks from registration year to current year
for (let year = registrationYear; year <= currentYear; year++) {
    // First year tasks (only for registration year)
    if (year === registrationYear && rules.firstYear) {
        // Add first year specific tasks
    }
    
    // Annual tasks (for all years)
    if (rules.annual) {
        // Add recurring annual tasks
    }
}
```

### Country-Specific Rules
Each country has specific compliance requirements:

#### USA
- **C-Corporation**: Articles of Incorporation, Corporate Bylaws, Annual Reports, Tax Returns
- **LLC**: Articles of Organization, Operating Agreement, EIN Application
- **S-Corporation**: Articles of Incorporation, S-Corporation Election, Annual Reports

#### UK
- **Limited Company**: Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum of Association, Annual Returns
- **PLC**: Certificate of Incorporation, Prospectus, Annual Accounts

#### India
- **Private Limited**: Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum, Articles, Annual Returns
- **LLP**: Certificate of Incorporation, LLP Agreement, Partner Consent Forms

#### Singapore
- **Private Limited**: Certificate of Incorporation, Company Constitution, Annual Returns
- **Exempt Private**: Certificate of Incorporation, Company Constitution

#### Germany
- **GmbH**: Certificate of Incorporation, Articles of Association, Commercial Register Entry
- **AG**: Certificate of Incorporation, Articles of Association, Prospectus

## Real-Time Features

### 1. Profile Updates
- Changes to country, company type, or registration date immediately update compliance tasks
- No page refresh required
- Real-time synchronization across all connected clients

### 2. Compliance Status Updates
- CA/CS users can update verification status in real-time
- Changes are immediately reflected in the UI
- Backend updates are synchronized

### 3. Document Uploads
- Upload progress tracking
- Real-time document list updates
- Immediate availability of uploaded documents

## Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Startups**: Can only access their own compliance data
- **CA/CS Users**: Can view and update all compliance data
- **Admins**: Full access to all compliance data

### Storage Policies
- **Startups**: Can upload/view their own documents
- **CA/CS Users**: Can view all compliance documents
- **Admins**: Full access to all documents

## Usage Examples

### 1. Setting Up a New Startup
1. **Profile Tab**: Set country (e.g., USA), company type (e.g., C-Corporation), registration date (e.g., 2022-01-15)
2. **Compliance Tab**: Automatically shows tasks from 2022 to current year
3. **Upload Documents**: Click upload button to add compliance documents
4. **CA/CS Verification**: CA and CS users can verify uploaded documents

### 2. Adding a Subsidiary
1. **Profile Tab**: Add subsidiary with country, company type, and registration date
2. **Compliance Tab**: Automatically generates compliance tasks for the subsidiary
3. **Separate Tracking**: Subsidiary compliance is tracked separately from parent company

### 3. Yearly Compliance
1. **Automatic Updates**: New compliance tasks are automatically added each year
2. **Historical Tracking**: Previous years' compliance is preserved
3. **Status Management**: Track completion status for each year

## Database Triggers

### Automatic Task Creation
```sql
-- Trigger to create compliance tasks when startup profile is updated
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_create_compliance_tasks
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON public.startups
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION public.create_compliance_tasks();
```

### Subsidiary Task Management
```sql
-- Trigger to create compliance tasks when subsidiaries are added
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_subsidiary_compliance_tasks
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON public.subsidiaries
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION public.update_subsidiary_compliance_tasks();
```
