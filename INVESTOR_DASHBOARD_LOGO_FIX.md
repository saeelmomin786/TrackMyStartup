# ✅ **Investor Dashboard Logo Overlap Issue - FIXED**

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

**Issue**: In the investor dashboard, two "Track My Startup" logos were overlapping each other, creating a visual glitch where the text appeared duplicated and misaligned.

**Root Cause**: The `AdvisorAwareLogo` component was rendering both an advisor logo and a hidden fallback TrackMyStartup logo simultaneously. The CSS `display: none` wasn't working properly, causing both logos to be visible at the same time.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **✅ Before (Broken)**
```jsx
// Problematic approach - rendered both logos simultaneously
if (advisorInfo?.logo_url) {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 sm:gap-3">
      <img 
        src={advisorInfo.logo_url} 
        alt={advisorInfo.name || 'Advisor Logo'} 
        className={className}
        onClick={onClick}
        onError={(e) => {
          // Fallback logic that could cause overlap
          e.currentTarget.style.display = 'none';
          const fallbackImg = e.currentTarget.nextElementSibling as HTMLImageElement;
          if (fallbackImg) {
            fallbackImg.style.display = 'block';
          }
        }}
      />
      <img 
        src={LogoTMS} 
        alt={alt} 
        className={className}
        onClick={onClick}
        style={{ display: 'none' }} // This wasn't working properly
      />
      {/* Text content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **✅ After (Fixed)**
```jsx
// Clean approach - only renders one logo at a time
const [logoError, setLogoError] = useState(false);

// If user has an advisor with a logo and no error, show advisor logo
if (advisorInfo?.logo_url && !logoError) {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 sm:gap-3">
      <img 
        src={advisorInfo.logo_url} 
        alt={advisorInfo.name || 'Advisor Logo'} 
        className={className}
        onClick={onClick}
        onError={() => {
          console.log('🔍 AdvisorAwareLogo: Advisor logo failed to load, falling back to TrackMyStartup');
          setLogoError(true); // Triggers re-render with fallback logo
        }}
      />
      {/* Text content */}
    </div>
  );
}

// Default TrackMyStartup logo (fallback or no advisor)
return (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 sm:gap-3">
    <img 
      src={LogoTMS} 
      alt={alt} 
      className={className}
      onClick={onClick}
    />
    {/* Text content */}
  </div>
);
```

## 📊 **Key Changes Made**

### **✅ 1. Removed Simultaneous Logo Rendering**
- **Before**: Rendered both advisor logo and hidden fallback logo
- **After**: Only renders one logo at a time based on state

### **✅ 2. Added Error State Management**
- **Added**: `logoError` state to track when advisor logo fails to load
- **Result**: Clean fallback mechanism without overlap

### **✅ 3. Simplified Error Handling**
- **Before**: Complex DOM manipulation with `display: none/block`
- **After**: Simple state-based re-rendering

### **✅ 4. Eliminated CSS Conflicts**
- **Before**: Relied on CSS `display: none` which wasn't working properly
- **After**: Uses React state to control which logo to render

## 🎯 **Technical Benefits**

### **✅ State-Based Rendering**
- Only one logo is rendered at any given time
- No CSS conflicts or display issues
- Clean component lifecycle management

### **✅ Proper Error Handling**
- Advisor logo fails → automatically switches to TrackMyStartup logo
- No visual glitches or overlapping
- Smooth user experience

### **✅ Performance Improvement**
- No unnecessary DOM elements
- Cleaner component structure
- Better memory usage

## 🚀 **Results**

### **✅ Before Fix:**
- ❌ Two logos overlapping each other
- ❌ Visual glitch with duplicated text
- ❌ Poor user experience
- ❌ CSS display issues

### **✅ After Fix:**
- ✅ **Single logo display** - Only one logo shown at a time
- ✅ **Clean fallback** - Smooth transition when advisor logo fails
- ✅ **No overlapping** - Eliminated visual glitches
- ✅ **Proper error handling** - Graceful fallback mechanism
- ✅ **Better performance** - No unnecessary DOM elements

## 🎉 **Status: COMPLETELY FIXED**

The investor dashboard logo overlap issue has been resolved:
- **✅ No more overlapping logos** - Only one logo displays at a time
- **✅ Clean fallback mechanism** - Smooth transition when needed
- **✅ Proper error handling** - Graceful handling of logo load failures
- **✅ Better performance** - Cleaner component structure
- **✅ Improved user experience** - No visual glitches

**The investor dashboard now displays logos correctly without any overlapping issues!** 🚀

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was caused by:
1. **Simultaneous rendering** of both advisor and fallback logos
2. **CSS display conflicts** where `display: none` wasn't working properly
3. **DOM manipulation** in error handlers causing timing issues
4. **Lack of proper state management** for logo error states

The fix eliminates all these issues by using React state to control which logo to render, ensuring only one logo is visible at any time.
