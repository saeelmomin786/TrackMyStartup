# Investment Advisor Dashboard Bug Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The investment advisor dashboard was not showing any entries in the "My Investor Offers" and "My Startup Offers" tables, even when startups and investors had added the investment advisor code.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The filtering logic in `InvestmentAdvisorView.tsx` was using the wrong field names to match investment advisor codes:

### **Incorrect Logic (Before Fix):**
```typescript
// WRONG: Looking for advisor's own code on investors
const myInvestors = users.filter(user => 
  user.role === 'Investor' && 
  (user as any).investment_advisor_code === currentUser?.investment_advisor_code
);
```

### **Correct Logic (After Fix):**
```typescript
// CORRECT: Looking for the code the investor entered during registration
const myInvestors = users.filter(user => 
  user.role === 'Investor' && 
  (user as any).investment_advisor_code_entered === currentUser?.investment_advisor_code
);
```

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Field Name Correction**
- **For Investors**: Changed from `investment_advisor_code` to `investment_advisor_code_entered`
- **For Startups**: Kept `investment_advisor_code` (this was correct)

### **2. Database Schema Understanding**
The database stores investment advisor codes differently:
- **Investment Advisors**: Have `investment_advisor_code` (their own unique code)
- **Investors**: Have `investment_advisor_code_entered` (the code they entered when registering)
- **Startups**: Have `investment_advisor_code` (the code they entered when registering)

### **3. Debug Logging Added**
Added comprehensive debug logging to help verify the data flow:
```typescript
console.log('🔍 Investment Advisor Debug:', {
  currentUserCode: currentUser?.investment_advisor_code,
  totalUsers: users.length,
  totalStartups: startups.length,
  investorsWithCodes: users.filter(u => u.role === 'Investor' && (u as any).investment_advisor_code_entered).length,
  startupsWithCodes: startups.filter(s => (s as any).investment_advisor_code).length,
  myInvestors: myInvestors.length,
  myStartups: myStartups.length,
  sampleInvestor: users.find(u => u.role === 'Investor' && (u as any).investment_advisor_code_entered),
  sampleStartup: startups.find(s => (s as any).investment_advisor_code)
});
```

## 📊 **Expected Results**

After the fix, the investment advisor dashboard should now correctly display:

### **My Investor Offers Table:**
- Shows investors who entered the advisor's code during registration
- Displays their investment offers and activities

### **My Startup Offers Table:**
- Shows startups who entered the advisor's code during registration
- Displays their fundraising activities and offers received

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for the debug output to verify data is being loaded correctly
2. **Verify Data**: Ensure investors and startups have the correct investment advisor codes stored
3. **Test Dashboard**: Check that the tables now populate with the correct entries

## 🔍 **Debug Script**

Created `DEBUG_INVESTMENT_ADVISOR_DATA.sql` to help verify the database state:
- Checks if columns exist
- Shows all users with investment advisor codes
- Shows all startups with investment advisor codes
- Displays relationship data

## ✅ **Files Modified**

1. **`components/InvestmentAdvisorView.tsx`**:
   - Fixed filtering logic for investors
   - Added debug logging
   - Maintained correct filtering for startups

2. **`DEBUG_INVESTMENT_ADVISOR_DATA.sql`** (Created):
   - Database debugging script
   - Helps verify data integrity

The investment advisor dashboard should now correctly display entries for investors and startups who have used the advisor's code! 🚀
