# Investor Offers Display Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

Investor offers were not being displayed in the "Offers Made by My Investors" section of the Investment Advisor dashboard.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The filtering logic in `InvestmentAdvisorView.tsx` was using incorrect field names to match offers with investors:

**Before (Incorrect):**
```typescript
// Using investor_id and startup_id (which don't exist in the offers data)
const offersMadeByMyInvestors = offers.filter(offer => 
  investorIds.includes(offer.investor_id)
);

const offersReceivedByMyStartups = offers.filter(offer => 
  startupIds.includes(offer.startup_id)
);
```

**After (Correct):**
```typescript
// Using investorEmail and startupName (which match the actual offer data structure)
const offersMadeByMyInvestors = offers.filter(offer => 
  investorEmails.includes(offer.investorEmail)
);

const offersReceivedByMyStartups = offers.filter(offer => 
  startupNames.includes(offer.startupName)
);
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Field Name Mismatches**
- Changed `offer.investor_id` → `offer.investorEmail`
- Changed `offer.startup_id` → `offer.startupName`
- Updated filtering to use email addresses and names instead of IDs

### 2. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose data flow issues:

```typescript
console.log('🔍 Debug offersMadeByMyInvestors:', {
  totalOffers: offers.length,
  myInvestors: myInvestors.length,
  investorEmails,
  sampleOffer: offers[0]
});
```

### 3. **Fixed All Related Filtering Logic**
- `offersMadeByMyInvestors` - Now correctly filters by investor email
- `offersReceivedByMyStartups` - Now correctly filters by startup name  
- `myDeals` - Now correctly filters by both investor email and startup name

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

1. **Go to Investment Advisor Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to "My Investors" tab**
3. **Check "Offers Made by My Investors" section**
4. **Verify offers are now displayed**

### Expected Console Output:
```
🔍 Debug myInvestors: { totalUsers: X, filteredCount: Y, ... }
🔍 Debug offersMadeByMyInvestors: { totalOffers: X, myInvestors: Y, ... }
```

## 📊 **Data Structure Alignment**

The fix ensures the filtering logic matches the actual offer data structure:

**Offer Object Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: number,
  investorEmail: string,    // ← Used for filtering
  startupName: string,      // ← Used for filtering
  offerAmount: number,
  equityPercentage: number,
  status: string,
  createdAt: string
}
```

**Investor Object Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  email: string,            // ← Matches offer.investorEmail
  name: string,
  role: 'Investor',
  advisor_accepted: true
}
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After this fix:
- ✅ Investor offers appear in "Offers Made by My Investors" section
- ✅ Startup offers appear in "Offers Received by My Startups" section
- ✅ Deals appear in "My Deals" section
- ✅ Debug logging helps identify any remaining data issues

## 📋 **Files Modified**

- `components/InvestmentAdvisorView.tsx` - Fixed filtering logic and added debug logging

The investor offers should now display correctly in the Investment Advisor dashboard! 🚀
