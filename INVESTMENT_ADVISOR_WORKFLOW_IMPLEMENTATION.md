# Investment Advisor Workflow Implementation

## ✅ **Complete Workflow Implementation**

I've implemented the complete investment advisor workflow as requested. Here's what has been changed:

## 🔄 **Workflow Overview**

### **1. Request Flow**
- **Investors/Startups** enter investment advisor code → appears in "My Investor Offers" or "My Startup Offers" tables
- **Investment Advisor** can accept requests after adding financial matrix and agreement
- **After acceptance** → moved to "My Investors" or "My Startups" tables

### **2. Activity Tracking**
- **Offers Made by My Investors** → tracked in separate table
- **Offers Received by My Startups** → tracked in separate table
- **Investment Interests** → from Discover Pitches likes by my investors
- **My Deals** → accepted offers involving my investors or startups

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **1. Tab Rename**
- **"My Offers"** → **"My Deals"**
- Updated navigation and content accordingly

### **2. Data Filtering Logic**
```typescript
// Pending requests (not yet accepted)
const pendingInvestorRequests = users.filter(user => 
  user.role === 'Investor' && 
  (user as any).investment_advisor_code_entered === currentUser?.investment_advisor_code &&
  !(user as any).advisor_accepted
);

// Accepted relationships
const myInvestors = users.filter(user => 
  user.role === 'Investor' && 
  (user as any).investment_advisor_code_entered === currentUser?.investment_advisor_code &&
  (user as any).advisor_accepted === true
);
```

### **3. Table Updates**

#### **My Investor Offers Table**
- Shows **pending investor requests**
- Displays investor name, email, and status
- **"Accept Request"** button for each pending request

#### **My Startup Offers Table**
- Shows **pending startup requests**
- Displays startup name, funding range, sector, and status
- **"Accept Request"** button for each pending request

#### **My Deals Table**
- Shows **accepted offers** involving advisor's investors or startups
- Displays startup, investor, deal amount, equity, and status
- Only shows deals with "accepted" status

### **4. New Data Tracking**
```typescript
// Offers made by accepted investors
const offersMadeByMyInvestors = investmentOffers.filter(offer => 
  myInvestors.some(investor => investor.email === offer.investorEmail)
);

// Offers received by accepted startups
const offersReceivedByMyStartups = investmentOffers.filter(offer => 
  myStartups.some(startup => startup.name === offer.startupName)
);

// Investment interests from Discover Pitches
const investmentInterests = newInvestments.filter(investment => 
  myInvestors.some(investor => investor.email === investment.investorEmail)
);

// Deals (accepted offers)
const myDeals = investmentOffers.filter(offer => 
  (myInvestors.some(investor => investor.email === offer.investorEmail) ||
   myStartups.some(startup => startup.name === offer.startupName)) &&
  offer.status === 'accepted'
);
```

5. **Offers Made by My Investors** - Investment offers from accepted investors
6. **Offers Received by My Startups** - Investment offers to accepted startups

### **Step 3: Activity Tracking**
