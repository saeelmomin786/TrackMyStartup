# Investor Panel & Unique Code Generation System Guide

## Overview
Your application has a comprehensive **Investor Panel** with a sophisticated **Unique Code Generation System** that automatically assigns unique identifiers to investors. This system ensures each investor has a unique code for tracking investments and managing their portfolio.

## 🎯 Unique Code Generation System

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Generation**: When a user registers as an "Investor", the system automatically generates a unique code
2. **Format**: `INV-XXXXXX` (e.g., `INV-A7B3C9`)
3. **Uniqueness**: Each code is guaranteed to be unique across the entire system
4. **Database Storage**: Codes are stored in the `users.investor_code` column

### Code Generation Process
```typescript
// From utils.ts
export function generateInvestorCode(): string {
  const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789';
  let result = 'INV-';
  
  for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    result += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length));
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

### Database Setup
- **Table**: `users`
- **Column**: `investor_code` (TEXT)
- **Index**: `idx_users_investor_code` for performance
- **Constraints**: Unique per user

   - Shows your user ID, email, role, and code status
   - Displays both `investor_code` and `investorCode` fields

2. **Common Issues**:
   - **Missing Code**: Database column not set up
   - **Empty Code**: Code generation failed
   - **Invalid Format**: Code doesn't match expected pattern

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Refresh the page to reload your profile
   - Check if you're logged in as an Investor role

## 📊 Investment Tracking

### How Investment Codes Work:
1. **Investment Records**: Each investment is linked to an investor code
2. **Portfolio Tracking**: System tracks all investments by code
3. **Startup Requests**: Investors can approve startups to add to their portfolio
4. **Offer Management**: Track investment offers and their status

### Investment Flow:
```
Startup Request → Investor Approval → Portfolio Addition → Investment Tracking
```
