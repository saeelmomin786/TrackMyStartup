# Investment Advisor Bug Fixes

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. ReferenceError: myStartupOffers is not defined**
**Problem**: The app was showing a blank screen when clicking on "My Startups" or "My Investors" tabs with the error:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: myStartupOffers is not defined
```

**Root Cause**: During the refactoring to implement the new workflow, the variable names were changed but some references weren't updated.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `myInvestorOffers` → `offersMadeByMyInvestors`
- Updated `myStartupOffers` → `offersReceivedByMyStartups`

### **2. Duplicate Variable Declaration**
**Problem**: There was a duplicate `investmentInterests` declaration causing compilation errors.

**Root Cause**: During refactoring, some old code wasn't properly removed.

**Fix Applied**: Removed duplicate declarations and consolidated the logic.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **Variable Name Updates**
```typescript
// Before (causing errors)
{myInvestorOffers.map(offer => (
{myStartupOffers.map(offer => (

// After (fixed)
{offersMadeByMyInvestors.map(offer => (
{offersReceivedByMyStartups.map(offer => (
```

### **Empty State Messages Added**
```typescript
// Added proper empty state handling
{offersMadeByMyInvestors.length === 0 ? (
  <tr>
    <td colSpan={5} className="px-6 py-8 text-center text-slate-500">
      No offers made by your investors yet
    </td>
  </tr>
) : (
  offersMadeByMyInvestors.map(offer => (
    // ... table rows
  ))
)}
```

## 📊 **Tables Fixed**

### **1. Offers Made by My Investors**
- **Location**: My Investors tab
- **Content**: Shows investment offers made by accepted investors
- **Empty State**: "No offers made by your investors yet"

### **2. Offers Received by My Startups**
- **Location**: My Startups tab  
- **Content**: Shows investment offers received by accepted startups
- **Empty State**: "No offers received by your startups yet"

## ✅ **Results**

1. **No More Blank Screens**: The "My Investors" and "My Startups" tabs now load properly
2. **Proper Data Display**: Tables show the correct data based on the new workflow
3. **Better UX**: Added empty state messages when no data is available
4. **No Compilation Errors**: All variable references are now correct

## 🧪 **Testing**

The investment advisor dashboard should now work correctly:
- ✅ "My Investors" tab loads without errors
- ✅ "My Startups" tab loads without errors  
- ✅ Tables display appropriate data or empty states
- ✅ No console errors

The investment advisor workflow is now fully functional! 🚀
