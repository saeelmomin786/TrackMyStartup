# Country-Specific Professional Titles in Compliance Headers

## ‚úÖ **Implementation Complete**

The compliance table headers now display country-specific professional titles instead of generic "CA VERIFIED" and "CS VERIFIED".

## üîß **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Professional Titles Mapping Function** (`lib/utils.ts`)
Added `getCountryProfessionalTitles()` function that maps country codes to appropriate professional titles:

**Examples:**
- **Austria (AT)**: "Tax Advisor" / "Management"
- **India (IN)**: "Chartered Accountant" / "Company Secretary"  
- **United States (US)**: "CPA" / "Corporate Secretary"
- **Germany (DE)**: "Tax Advisor" / "Management"
- **Singapore (SG)**: "Chartered Accountant" / "Company Secretary"

### **2. Dynamic Header Generation** (`ComplianceTab.tsx`)
- **Extracts country code** from entity names (e.g., "Parent Company (AT)" ‚Üí "AT")
- **Dynamically generates headers** based on country-specific professional titles
- **Maintains fallback** to "CA" / "CS" for unknown countries

## üìä **Results**

### **Before:**
```
| Year | Task | CA VERIFIED | CS VERIFIED | Action |
```

### **After (Austria example):**
```
| Year | Task | Tax Advisor Verified | Management Verified | Action |
```

### **After (India example):**
```
| Year | Task | Chartered Accountant Verified | Company Secretary Verified | Action |
```
