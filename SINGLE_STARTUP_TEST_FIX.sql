-- SINGLE STARTUP TEST FIX (SAFE TO TEST)
-- =====================================================
-- This script fixes calculations for ONE startup only
-- Replace 'YOUR_STARTUP_ID' with your actual startup ID

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 2: CHECK CURRENT DATA FOR YOUR STARTUP
-- =====================================================
