### 3. State Management Implementation

#### Co-Investment State Management
- **Files Modified**: `components/InvestmentAdvisorView.tsx`, `components/InvestorView.tsx`
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `coInvestmentListings` state using `useState<Set<number>>`
  - Implemented `handleSeekCoInvestors` function for toggling listing status
  - State tracks which investments/startups have been listed for co-investment
  - Button appearance changes based on listing status

### 4. Database Schema

#### Co-Investment Database Schema
- **File Created**: `CO_INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITIES_SCHEMA.sql`
- **Implementation**:
  - **co_investment_opportunities**: Main table for storing co-investment opportunities
  - **co_investment_interests**: Table for tracking user interest in opportunities
  - **co_investment_approvals**: Table for investment advisor approvals
  - Comprehensive indexes for performance optimization
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control
  - Database functions for common operations:
    - `create_co_investment_opportunity()`
    - `get_co_investment_opportunities_for_user()`
    - `get_all_co_investment_opportunities()`
    - `express_co_investment_interest()`
    - `approve_co_investment_interest()`

### 5. Service Layer

#### Co-Investment Service
- **File Created**: `lib/coInvestmentService.ts`
- **Implementation**:
  - TypeScript interfaces for all co-investment entities
  - Service class with methods for all CRUD operations
  - API integration ready (endpoints need to be implemented)
  - Error handling and logging
  - Singleton pattern for service instance

## ðŸ”„ Filtering Logic Implementation

### Investment Advisor Access
- Investment advisors can see **all** co-investment opportunities across the platform
- No restrictions based on advisor relationships

### Investor Access (Based on Advisor Relationship)
- **With Investment Advisor**: Investors only see co-investment opportunities that have been approved by their investment advisor
- **Without Investment Advisor**: Investors can see all co-investment opportunities
- Filtering logic implemented in database functions and service layer

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Features

### Button States
- **Default State**: Blue background (`bg-blue-100 text-blue-800`) with "Seek Co-Investors" text
- **Active State**: Green background (`bg-green-100 text-green-800`) with "Co-investment Listed" text
- Smooth transitions with `transition-colors duration-200`
- Hover effects for better user interaction

### Table Design
- Consistent styling with existing tables
- Responsive design with horizontal scrolling
- Clear column headers and data presentation
- Action buttons properly aligned

### Navigation
- Profile button integrated seamlessly with header design
- New co-investment tab with appropriate icon
- Maintains existing navigation structure

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. API Endpoints
Create the following API endpoints to connect the frontend with the database:
- `POST /api/co-investment/create-opportunity`
- `GET /api/co-investment/opportunities/:userId`
- `GET /api/co-investment/opportunities`
- `POST /api/co-investment/express-interest`
- `POST /api/co-investment/approve-interest`
- `PATCH /api/co-investment/opportunity/:id/status`
- `GET /api/co-investment/opportunity/:id/interests`
- `GET /api/co-investment/opportunity/:id/approvals`

### 2. Database Migration
Run the `CO_INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITIES_SCHEMA.sql` script to create the necessary database tables and functions.

### 3. Data Integration
Connect the frontend components with the co-investment service to display real data instead of placeholder content.

### 4. Testing
- Test the button state changes
- Verify filtering logic works correctly
- Test the complete co-investment workflow

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React `useState` with `Set<number>` for efficient tracking of listed items
- State is component-scoped (not global) for simplicity
- Easy to extend to global state management if needed

### Database Design
- Normalized schema with proper foreign key relationships
- Comprehensive indexing for performance
- Row Level Security for data protection
- Audit trails with created_at/updated_at timestamps

### Service Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Error handling and logging
- Ready for API integration
