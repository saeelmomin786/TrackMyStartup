# Profile & Compliance Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how the ProfileTab and ComplianceTab components work together to provide a comprehensive company profile and compliance management system.

## Architecture

### 1. ProfileTab Component

The ProfileTab component manages company profile information including:

- **Primary Details**: Country, company type, registration date
- **Service Providers**: CA (Chartered Accountant) and CS (Company Secretary) assignments
- **Subsidiaries**: Multiple subsidiary companies with their own service providers
- **International Operations**: Countries where business is conducted without subsidiaries

### 2. ComplianceTab Component

The ComplianceTab component generates compliance tasks based on:

- Company registration dates
- Country-specific compliance rules
- Service provider assignments (CA/CS)
- Entity structure (parent company + subsidiaries)

## Key Features

### Service Provider Management

#### Service Provider Codes
- **CA Codes**: Chartered Accountant service codes (e.g., CA001, CA002)
- **CS Codes**: Company Secretary service codes (e.g., CS001, CS002)

#### Service Provider Assignment
1. **Primary Company**: Can assign CA and CS service providers
2. **Subsidiaries**: Each subsidiary can have its own CA and CS service providers
3. **Auto-fetch**: When a valid service code is entered, the system automatically fetches provider details

#### Service Provider Display
- Shows provider name and license link
- Allows changing providers in edit mode
- Displays "View License" link for verification

### Compliance Task Generation

#### Entity-based Tasks
The system generates compliance tasks for:
- **Parent Company**: Based on registration date and country
- **Subsidiaries**: Each subsidiary gets its own set of compliance tasks
- **International Operations**: May generate additional compliance requirements

#### Task Assignment
- **CA Tasks**: Assigned to the CA service provider for each entity
- **CS Tasks**: Assigned to the CS service provider for each entity
- **Verification**: Only assigned service providers can update task status

#### Compliance Status
- **Pending**: Task awaiting verification
- **Verified**: Task completed and verified
- **Rejected**: Task failed verification
- **Not Required**: Task not applicable for this entity

## Database Schema

### Service Providers Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE service_providers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    code VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('ca', 'cs')),
    license_url TEXT,
    country VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Subsidiaries Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE subsidiaries 
ADD COLUMN ca_service_code VARCHAR(50) REFERENCES service_providers(code),
ADD COLUMN cs_service_code VARCHAR(50) REFERENCES service_providers(code);
```

### Startups Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE startups 
ADD COLUMN ca_service_code VARCHAR(50) REFERENCES service_providers(code),
ADD COLUMN cs_service_code VARCHAR(50) REFERENCES service_providers(code);
```

## Integration Flow

### 1. Profile Setup
1. User enters company details in ProfileTab
2. User assigns service providers by entering service codes
3. System validates service codes and fetches provider details

### 2. Compliance Generation
1. ComplianceTab reads profile data
2. Generates compliance tasks based on:
   - Registration dates
   - Country-specific rules
   - Company types
3. Assigns tasks to appropriate service providers

### 3. Task Management
1. Service providers log in with their service codes
2. They see only tasks assigned to them
3. They can update task status (Pending â†’ Verified/Rejected)
4. Changes are reflected in real-time
