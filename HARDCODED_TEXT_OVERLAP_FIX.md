# ✅ **Hardcoded Text Overlap Issue - FIXED**

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

**Issue**: The investor dashboard was showing two overlapping "Track My Startup" logos - one from the SVG image and another from hardcoded text in the React component.

**Root Cause**: The `AdvisorAwareLogo` component was rendering both:
1. **SVG Logo**: `LogoTMS.svg` which already contains "Track My Startup" text
2. **Hardcoded Text**: Additional "TrackMyStartup" text rendered by the component

This caused the text to appear twice, creating the overlapping effect.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **✅ Before (Broken)**
```jsx
// Default TrackMyStartup logo
return (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 sm:gap-3">
    <img 
      src={LogoTMS} 
      alt={alt} 
      className={className}
      onClick={onClick}
    />
    {showText && (
      <h1 className={textClassName}>
        TrackMyStartup  {/* ← This was causing the overlap! */}
      </h1>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

### **✅ After (Fixed)**
```jsx
// Default TrackMyStartup logo
return (
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 sm:gap-3">
    <img 
      src={LogoTMS} 
      alt={alt} 
      className={className}
      onClick={onClick}
    />
    {/* Note: LogoTMS.svg already contains the "Track My Startup" text, so no additional text needed */}
  </div>
);
```

## 📊 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **✅ The Issue**
- **SVG Logo**: `LogoTMS.svg` already contains the "Track My Startup" text as part of the image
- **Hardcoded Text**: The component was adding additional "TrackMyStartup" text next to the logo
- **Result**: Two instances of the same text rendered, causing overlap

### **✅ The Fix**
- **Removed**: Hardcoded "TrackMyStartup" text from the default logo rendering
- **Kept**: Only the SVG logo which already contains the text
- **Result**: Single, clean logo display without overlap

## 🎯 **Logo Storage and Rendering**

### **✅ Default Logo (TrackMyStartup)**
- **File**: `components/public/logoTMS.svg`
- **Content**: SVG image with embedded "Track My Startup" text
- **Rendering**: Only the SVG image, no additional text

### **✅ Investment Advisor Logo**
- **Source**: `users.logo_url` field in database
- **Rendering**: Advisor logo + advisor name + "Supported by Track My Startup" text
- **Logic**: Only shows when advisor is assigned and has uploaded a logo

## 🚀 **Results**

### **✅ Before Fix:**
- ❌ Two overlapping "Track My Startup" texts
- ❌ Visual glitch with duplicated text
- ❌ Hardcoded text conflicting with SVG content
- ❌ Poor user experience

### **✅ After Fix:**
- ✅ **Single logo display** - Only the SVG logo with embedded text
- ✅ **No overlapping** - Eliminated hardcoded text duplication
- ✅ **Clean rendering** - Proper logo display without conflicts
- ✅ **Better user experience** - No visual glitches

## 🎉 **Status: COMPLETELY FIXED**

The hardcoded text overlap issue has been resolved:
- **✅ No more overlapping text** - Only the SVG logo renders
- **✅ Clean logo display** - Single, proper logo rendering
- **✅ No hardcoded text conflicts** - Removed duplicate text rendering
- **✅ Better performance** - No unnecessary text elements
- **✅ Improved user experience** - No visual glitches

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **✅ Logo Rendering Logic**
1. **If advisor assigned + has logo**: Show advisor logo + advisor name + "Supported by Track My Startup"
2. **If no advisor or no logo**: Show default SVG logo only (no additional text)

### **✅ Why This Fix Works**
- **SVG Logo**: Already contains the "Track My Startup" text as part of the image
- **No Duplication**: Removed the hardcoded text that was causing overlap
- **Clean Rendering**: Only one source of text display

**The investor dashboard now displays logos correctly without any overlapping text!** 🚀

## 📝 **Key Takeaway**

The issue was caused by rendering both the SVG logo (which contains text) AND additional hardcoded text. The fix was to remove the hardcoded text since the SVG already contains the necessary text content.
